                <h1> Welcome to the home page of our family farm, Sunny Acres, where there's always something happening.
                    With the coming of fall, we're gearing up for our big AutumnFest and Farm Show. If you haven't
                    visited our famous Corn Maze, be sure to do so before it gets torn down on November 5. This year's
                    maze is bigger and better than ever.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Farms can be educational and Sunny Acres is no exception. Schools and home-schooling parents, take
                    an afternoon with us at our Petting Barn. We have over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean
                    environment. Kids can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs, and calves while they learn about nature
                    and the farming life. Please call ahead for large school groups.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for a good fright. Sunny Acres provides
                    that too with another year of the Haunted Maze. Please plan on joining us during weekends in October
                    or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.

                    Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. Our Farm Shop is always open with reasonable prices and
                    great produce. Save even more money by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and
                    gardens.
                    <br>
                    We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.
